Broken things
-------------

- Get rid of all the irrefutable Cursor matches.
  This is going to break a lot when we bring in the different cursor types.
- Remove references to StringBufferList in the editor.
  The editor should only make reference to the TextBuffer class.
- Disallow cursor moving beyond end of file? Pad lines to allow insert at new position?
- Limit the number of characters drawn across a line.
- Break apart the event loop so it doesn't poll and so the sleep time is dynamic.
  Eg: small sleep when we need to do something fast and smooth, long sleep when the editor is doing nothing.
  Maybe even better - use a TVar for the state and then have separate threads for drawing / processing...
- Better solution for passing information through the event loop.
- Align the shape of the cursor with the actual bounding box of the characters.
- Don't hardcode the font-path.
x Make the view size match the window size (with a 'resize' event.)
x Fix font rendering so it's not blurry.
x Do we even need events? Can the event queue just be a queue of (State -> State) functions?
x Crash on insert text beyond end of file.

Proper things
=============

- Cabal / Stack / proper build setup.
- Test for TextBuffer which can be instantiated per instance.

Basic editor functionality
--------------------------

- Allow inserting new lines
- Allow delete.
- Allow saving (auto-saving?)
- Undo.
  Make every text buffer op return the edit and the inverse edit? Then store a history of inverse edits?
  Break down the text buffer class? Use just insert-char delete-char at a buffer index, not line/num.
- Copy/paste and copy ring / cycle.
x Better move keys: home, end
x Allow backspace

Desirable editor functionality
------------------------------

- Fix cursor motion so it uses 'begin/end' events and we can control the repeat speed more precisely/smoothly.
  Eg: can implement 'smooth speedy move' modifier key.
- Markers from file:line locations in other open files.
- Easily jump to file:line locations.
- Smooth scrolling. Or at least, sub-characters-size scrolling.
- Simple search and highlight.

For the near and distant future
-------------------------------

- Implement a TextBuffer which is wiser than a string list.

Fancy things completely unrelated to text editing
-------------------------------------------------

- Time of day colour scheme.
    - HSV?
- Super faint background grid?

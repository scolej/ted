Broken things
-------------

- Crash on insert text beyond end of file.
- Cabal / Stack / proper build setup.
- Smooth scrolling.
- Limit the number of characters drawn across a line.
- Break apart the event loop so it doesn't poll and so the sleep time is dynamic.
  Eg: small sleep when we need to do something fast and smooth, long sleep when the editor is doing nothing.
  Maybe even better - use a TVar for the state and then have separate threads for drawing / processing...
- Better solution for passing information through the event loop.
- Align the shape of the cursor with the actual bounding box of the characters.
- Don't hardcode the font-path.
x Make the view size match the window size (with a 'resize' event.)
x Fix font rendering so it's not blurry.
x Do we even need events? Can the event queue just be a queue of (State -> State) functions?

Basic editor functionality
--------------------------

- Allow inserting new lines
- Allow backspace
- Allow saving (auto-saving?)
- Undo.
- Copy/paste and copy ring / cycle.
- Better move keys: home, end...

Desirable editor functionality
------------------------------

- Fix cursor motion so it uses 'begin/end' events and we can control the repeat speed more precisely/smoothly.
  Eg: can implement 'smooth speedy move' modifier key.
- Markers from file:line locations in other open files.
- Easily jump to file:line locations.

For the near and distant future
-------------------------------

- Implement a TextBuffer which is wiser than a string.

Fancy things completely unrelated to text editing
-------------------------------------------------

- Time of day colour scheme.
